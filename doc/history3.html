<h3>Coming to the version 3.2.x, not yet released</h3>

<p>
  Estimated release time for following additions <s>is fall 2009.</s> <i>was fall 2009, but the publishing is delayed.</i>
</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li><p>
      Faster spooling algorithm. Required if system has <u>lot</u> of modems and <u>very</u> much messages to send.
      Current algorithm works well on systems with less than 10 - 15 modems and with about 500 -600 messages per hour per each modem.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      SQL database based spooling and message handling.
      Can be used together with current filesystem based spooling, or instead of it.
      At least MySQL will be supported, probably SQLite too.
  </p></li>

</ol>

<h3>Version history</h3>

<b>21.10.2012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.15</b>

<p>
After a long time, some changes and fixes are pending, but in this version only one fix is applied.
The bug with lockfiles is very critical, and hopefully the creation of new package is easier for
maintainers, when only one fix is done.
</p>

<p>
Bug fixes:
<ol start="1">
  <li><p>
      When creating a lockfile, main process used incorrect offset -1 with the table of names of processes.
      This caused segmentation fault when smsd was compiled using latest compilers.
  </p></li>

<b>21.09.2010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.14</b>

<ol>
  <li><p>
      New setting for a modem: <i><b>signal_quality_ber_ignore = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>no</i>.</font><br>
      Some devices do not support <i>Bit Error Rate</i> when signal quality is asked, and this always provides
      "Bit Error Rate: not known or not detectable" to the log line and to the status file.
      With this setting <i>ber</i> can be ignored.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      When logging "SMS sent...", and there has been retries, count of retries is shown in the log line:<br>
      <i>SMS sent, Message_id: 12, To: 358401234567, sending time 34 sec. <b>Retries: 2</b></i>
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      When logging "SMS received...", and message is a status report, explanation of status is included in the log line:<br>
      <i>SMS received (report, Message_id: 12, Status: 0<b>,Ok,short message received by the SME</b>), From: 358401234567</i>
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      New setting for a modem: <i><b>verify_pdu = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>no</i>.</font><br>
      This setting is for testing purposes.
      When trying to send SMS and modem does not accept the PDU, there may be a communication problem which breaks the sent PDU.
      With this setting smsd changes "echo on", and verifies the string which is echoed back after the PDU was sent.
      In case of mismatch "Verify PDU: ERROR" is printed to the log and also both sent and received strings are logged.
      In case of success "Verify PDU: OK" is printed to the log.
      After the verification is done, "echo" is changed back to "off".
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      New setting for a modem: <i><b>loglevel_lac_ci = number/word</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>LOG_INFO</i>.</font><br>
      Sets the verbosity of logging the <i>Location area code</i> and <i>Cell ID</i> and their changes.
      This requires that AT+CREG? returns location information.
      It is automatically enabled by <i>pre_init</i> using a command <i>CREG=2</i>.
      After the Location are code or Cell ID changes, quality of signal is also logged.
      This feature can be disabled with the setting which is more than current loglevel, for example <i>8</i>.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      New setting for a modem: <i><b>log_not_registered_after = number</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>0</i>.</font><br>
      If it's known that the modem gives "not registered" after a message is sent or received,
      with this setting number of log messages can be avoided.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      When "<i>MODEM IS NOT REGISTERED, WAITING...</i>" is logged, also alarmhandler is called with a severity <i>LOG_NOTICE</i>.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      The script <b>email2sms</b> can handle e-mail with multiple recipients.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      New global settings:<br>
      <i><b>logtime_ms = yes/no</b></i><br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>no</i>.</font><br>
      <i><b>logtime_us = yes/no</b></i><br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>no</i>.</font><br>
      With these settings the timestamp in the log file can have microseconds or milliseconds shown.
      These settings can be used when a default format for timestamp is in use.
      Value is shown after seconds and is delimited with a dot.
      </p>
      <p>
      If <i>logtime_format</i> is defined, these settings have no effect.
      Milliseconds or microseconds can be included in customized <i>logtime_format</i> using keywords <i>timeus</i> or <i>timems</i>.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      When <i>max_continuous_sending</i> time is reached and smsd will do other tasks, 
      number of messages sent in max_continuous_sending time and average time for one 
      message is logged with loglevel <i>LOG_NOTICE</i>.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      When the sending of SMS fails, trying time and number of retries are logged.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New global setting: <i><b>shell_test = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>yes</i>.</font><br>
      When <i>executable_check</i> is enabled, testing of the <i>shell</i> can be omitted with this setting.
  </p></li>

</ol>

<p>
Bug fixes:
<ol start="13">
  <li><p>
      When <i>executable_check</i> was enabled, smsd tested the <i>shell</i> using a <i>/tmp</i> directory for the script.
      This caused failure when <i>/tmp</i> was mounted noexec.
      Smsd now uses the <i>incoming</i> directory for the test.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      Handling of headers failed when <i>/tmp</i> directory was on different mount than <i>/var/spool/sms</i> tree.
      This caused that message file was not moved to the <i>sent</i> or <i>failed</i> directory.
  </p></li>

</ol>
</p>

<hr>

<b>02.09.2010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.12</b>

<ol>
  <li><p>
      Handling of files in the spooler directory has changed.
      When large number of modems are serving the same queue, previously more than one modem tried to pick up the same file and in some cases 
      this caused conflicts and performance loss. 
      This new version will avoid conflicts by using the internal list of file candidates.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      Global setting <i>devices</i> can be given in the shorten form: devices = &lt;prefix&gt;* &lt;first_number&gt; - &lt;last_number&gt;.<br>
      For example: <b>devices = GSM* 101-164</b> produces the same as <b>devices = GSM101, GSM102, GSM103, etc. ...GSM164</b>.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      Modem settings <i>device</i> and <i>logfile</i> can have a special keyword <b>modemname</b>, which is replaced with a name of a modem.<br>
      For example:
      <ul><p>
        devices = USB0, USB1, USB2<br>
        <br>
        [default]<br>
        device = /dev/tty<b>modemname</b> <i>produces: device = /dev/ttyUSB0 and so on...</i><br>
        logfile = /var/log/smstools/GSM-<b>modemname</b>.log <i>produces: logfile = /var/log/smstools/GSM-USB0.log and so on...</i>
      </p></ul>
      </p>
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      It is no more mandatory that the modem section exists in the configuration file. 
      If all settings, including <i>device</i>, are set in the <i>default</i> section, modem section can be left out.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      Handling of timeout has changed. 
      Previously smsd was expecting the whole answer from the modem in the given time, 
      now timeout occurs if nothing is received in the given time.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      Lock files contain now process ID, and name of a device. 
      This is for monitoring purposes.
      With large number of lock files in the spooler it is easy to see what modems are sending messages currently.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      Modem commands <i>+CSQ</i> and <i>+CPIN</i> now allow "echo on". 
      However, in the normal operation "echo" should be set to off.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      When a quality of signal is logged, it's level is explained: 
      Marginal (-95dBm or lower) / Workable (-85dBm to -95dBm) / Good (-75dBm to -85dBm) / Excellent (above -75dBm).
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      When reading commands from regular_run_cmdfile, the expected answer can be defined in the begin of a line, between square brackets. 
      See the <a href="configure.html">How to configure</a> for details.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      When reading a file from the spooler and waiting if it is still growing, the time of waiting is reduced from one second to half seconds.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>smsc_pdu = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>no</i>.</font><br>
      If the number of SMSC is set in the configuration, or in the message file, the number is included in the PDU instead of changing SMSC with a command AT+CSCA.
      The number can be presented in international format, or in national format starting with 0.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>voicecall_clcc = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>no</i>.</font><br>
      Defines if AT+CLCC is used to detect when a call is answered.
      This is required if modem returns OK immediately after the call and <i>voicecall_cpas</i> cannot be used.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      When <i>check_memory_method</i> is set to use any CMGL method, larger buffer is used for handling the data.
      In normal cases about 400 messages can be handled.
      With some problematic devices the status report may contain extra padding which is almost 300 characters.
      This causes that about 50 status reports can be handled simultaneously.
      If this limit is reached, use some other than CMGL method.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      When a device is a socket (network modem) and is using Telnet protocol, smsd uses the Q Method implementation for option negotiation.
      Simply, every DO command is answered with WONT, and every WILL with DONT.
      This feature is very simple, and may not work with some devices or with some options.
      It is recommended to disable Telnet in the modem setup.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>telnet_login = string</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>empty</i>.</font><br>
      If a network modem requires telnet login, it can be defined with this setting.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>telnet_login_prompt = string</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>login:</i>.</font><br>
      If <i>telnet_login</i> is used, this setting can be used to change the login prompt.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>telnet_login_prompt_ignore = string</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>Last login:</i>.</font><br>
      If <i>telnet_login</i> is used and after successful login motd contains a string which is the same as <i>telnet_login_prompt</i>,
      this setting can be used to define which kind of a string is ignored.
      For example, <i>telnet_login_prompt</i> can be <i>login:</i> and <i>telnet_login_prompt_ignore</i> could be <i>Last login:</i>.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>telnet_password = string</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>empty</i>.</font><br>
      If <i>telnet_login</i> is used and device requires password, it can be defined with this setting.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>telnet_password_prompt = string</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>Password:</i>.</font><br>
      If <i>telnet_password</i> is used, this setting can be defined to change the prompt for password.
  </p></li>

</ol>

<p>
Bug fixes:
<ol start="20">
  <li><p>
      A modem setting <i>trust_spool</i> did not work properly. 
      When the spool directory was trusted, smsd did not check existence of lock files and this caused conflicts and slow performance 
      when large number of modems were serving the same queue directory.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      When headers of SMS file were handled, temporary files were created to the spooler directory. 
      With large number of modems and slow system this caused unnecessary error messages to the log. 
      Temporary files are now placed into the /tmp directory.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      When a command was read from the regular_run_cmdfile, control characters were removed from the string. 
      This caused that PDU termination (Ctrl-Z) could not be used.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      Even when <i>modem_disabled = yes</i> was used, smsd tried to initialize modem if <i>incoming = no</i> was used. 
      Also <i>send_startstring</i> and <i>send_stopstring</i> did not check if a modem is disabled.
  </p></li>

</ol>
</p>

<b>21.06.2010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.11</b>

<ol>
  <li><p>
      A modem setting <b>ussd_convert = number</b> can now have a new value: <b>4</b>.
      With this value text part from the USSD answer is converted from hexadecimal dump to ASCII.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      Some cleanup has been done to the code.

<b>17.06.2010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.9</b>

<ol>
  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>trust_spool = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>yes</i>.</font><br>
      When a modem process is searching for a file from the spooler, it assumes that the file is complete when it exists and it's not locked.
      This will speed up sending, because one second delay is avoided.
      If some other process or checkhandler is creating files directly to the spooler, it may be necessary to set this to <i>no</i>.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      When searching for a file to send, the lock file is created before the one second delay is spent.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New global setting: <i><b>log_read_from_modem = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>no</i>.</font><br>
      In some cases, when resolving troubles with a modem, it's useful to see exact data which is received from the modem.
      This setting is similar than <i>log_unmodified</i>, but displays the data as a hexadecimal dump.</i>
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      Programs <i>regular_run</i> and <i>regular_run_post_run</i> now get the device name as a third argument.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      The script <i>sendsms</i> has automatic detection of character set and creates Unicode messages if necessary.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>send_handshake_select = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>yes</i>.</font><br>
      Instead of checking the flag TIOCM_CTS, select() function is used when the serial transmitted is busy.
      If because of some reason the old style should be used, this setting allows it.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      With a setting <i>trim_text = yes</i>, whitespaces are not removed if the message is going blank.
      This is because some people, really, need to send a message which contains only single space character.
  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Bug fixes:
<ol start="8">
  <li><p>
    When manipulating strings, the coding style assumed that strcpy() and some other functions start copying from the begin of a buffer.
    That's how those have worked for years, but it's against what the manual of those functions says about overlapped buffers.
    With <b>64bit Ubuntu 10.04</b> running on <b>Intel</b> processor this caused serious failures.
    The code is reviewed and fixed.

      This is because smsd <u>must</u> hangup a call before it's handled.
      Smsd also initializes a modem with +CLIP=1 automatically to enable this functionality.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      File of a missed call has now more headers, like file of a received SMS has:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Subject:</b> &lt;modemname&gt;</li>
        <li><b>Modem:</b> &lt;modemname&gt;</li>
        <li><b>Number:</b> &lt;phone number&gt; (if defined in the configuration)</li>
        <li><b>IMSI:</b> &lt;string&gt; (if available)</li>
      </ul>
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      The setting <i>date_filename</i> now applies for files of missed calls too.
  </p></li>

</ol>

<p>
Bug fixes:
<ol start="4">
  <li><p>
      When <i>filename_preview</i> was used, creation of modified filename for message file of a missed call caused modem process to freeze.

      When running smsd as an unpriviledged user and <b>group</b> is defined,
      given group is added to the group access list which is initialized by reading the group database.
      In the previous versions of smsd the given group was used as only group.

<b>11.04.2010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.7beta4</b>
</p>

<p>
In addition to other changes, this version contains couple of changes which were provided as a patch by <i>yjh</i>,
a member of SMSTools3 Community.
<a href="http://smstools3.kekekasvi.com/topic.php?id=73">This topic</a> contains more details.
These changes were originally going to the version 3.2, but because it's still delayed, I publish those changes now.
</p>
<p>
In 3.2, handling of character sets is based on <i>iconv</i> and the code is widely changed.
Because the "iconv" patch in 3.1.7 is not very well tested, it's disabled by default.
Edit the src/Makefile to enable the patch, if necessary.
The patch requires that UTF-8 is used as a locale.
</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>New global setting: <i><b>logtime_format = format string</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>compatible with previous versions of smsd</i>.</font><br>
      With this setting a format of the timestamp in the logging can be set.
      The format string is strftime() compatible.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New global setting: <i><b>use_linux_ps_trick = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>no/yes</i></font><br>
      This setting changes the way how smsd processes are shown in the process list.
      Instead of command line, processes can be shown like "smsd: MAINPROCESS", "smsd: GSM1" etc.
      In the Makefile there is a definition which sets the default value for this setting.
      This is a "Linux trick", it's not quaranteed that this can be used in all possible environments.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      In the outgoing message file, the setting <b>System_message</b> can now have a value <i>2</i> or
      <b>ToSIM</b> for communicating with SIM applications.
      SMS is sent as <i>SS</i> (no show) and stored (sent) to SIM.
      Currently this only works with binary messages.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
      If <b>USE_ICONV</b> is defined in the src/Makefile, <i>iconv</i> is used for character set conversions.
      The current implementation works with Unicode and UTF-8 and could be used with cyrillic languages.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New global setting: <i><b>date_filename_format = format string</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>compatible with previous versions of smsd</i>.</font><br>
      With this setting a format of the timestamp in filenames (<i>date_filename >= 0</i>) can be set.
      The format string is strftime() compatible.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>device_open_retries = number</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>1</i>.</font><br>
      Defines how many times smsd will retry when cannot open a device.
      When maximum number of retries is reached, modem process will call alarmhandler and stop.
      With value -1 smsd will retry forever.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>device_open_alarm_after = number</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>0</i>.</font><br>
      After defined number of retries, an alarmhandler is called.
      Smsd still continues trying, if <i>device_open_retries</i> value is bigger.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>device_open_errorsleeptime = number</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>30</i>.</font><br>
      Defines how many seconds the smsd will sleep after an error with device open.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>socket_connection_errorsleeptime = number</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>5</i>.</font><br>
      Defines how many seconds the smsd will sleep after an error with socket connection.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New command line options: <i><b>-Ex</b></i> and <i><b>-Dx</b></i>.
      <ul>
      <li><b>-Ex</b> encodes a given string to the GSM 7bit packed format.
      The string can be written using ISO or UTF-8 alphabet.</li>
      <li><b>-Dx</b> decodes a given string from GSM 7bit packed format.
      The result uses ISO alphabet, or UTF-8 if <i>incoming_utf8 = yes</i> is defined in the configuration file.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Both options can used as a helper for USSD message handlers.
      When these optios are used, smsd does not start as a daemon.
      Therefore options can be used even when smsd is running as a daemon.
      </p>
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>ussd_convert = number</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>0</i>.</font><br>
      Defines if a text part from incoming USSD message is decoded.
      Possible values are:<br>
      <table border=1 bgcolor=lightgrey>
        <tr><td bgcolor=yellow valign=top>&nbsp;1&nbsp;</td><td>Unicode format is converted to UTF-8. This requires that USE_ICONV is defined.</td></tr>
        <tr><td bgcolor=yellow valign=top>&nbsp;2&nbsp;</td><td>GSM 7bit packed format is converted to ISO or UTF-8.</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>Decoded text is appended to the original answer with two slashes and one space character.
      </p>
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>eventhandler_ussd = filename</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>not in use</i>.</font><br>
      This setting defines an eventhandler to use with USSD messages.
      It is possible to use the same script or program which is used as <i>eventhandler</i>,
      but it's not a default because basically those scripts are not compatible without modifications.
      <br><br>
      After an USSD message is received, and probably <i>ussd_convert</i> is done, eventhandler_ussd is called.
      Smsd checks what is the current character set of a modem and creates a temporary file which contains the USSD answer.
      Arguments for the eventhandler_ussd are:<br>
      <table border=1 bgcolor=lightgrey>
        <tr><td bgcolor=yellow valign=top>&nbsp;$1&nbsp;</td><td>"USSD" keyword.</td></tr>
        <tr><td bgcolor=yellow valign=top>&nbsp;$2&nbsp;</td><td>Filename (which contains the answer).</td></tr>
        <tr><td bgcolor=yellow valign=top>&nbsp;$3&nbsp;</td><td>Devicename.</td></tr>
        <tr><td bgcolor=yellow valign=top>&nbsp;$4&nbsp;</td><td>Character set.</td></tr>
        <tr><td bgcolor=yellow valign=top>&nbsp;$5&nbsp;</td><td>Command what was used to get the USSD answer.</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>
      Eventhandler_ussd can do whatever is needed with the USSD answer.
      It can also modify the answer, or delete the file.
      After eventhandler_ussd returns, smsd will check if the file still exists.
      If it exists, it's first line is taken as a new answer.
      Modified answer is then logged and probably printed to the regular_run_statfile.

<b>30.03.2010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.7beta3</b>
</p>

One important feature has been requested, but I forgot to include it in the previous version :(.
So here it is:

<ol>
  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>regular_run_post_run = filename</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>not in use</i>.</font><br>
      This setting can define the second script or program which is executed regularly.
      The same script with <i>regular_run</i> can be used.
      The script gets an argument <i>$1</i> which is <i>PRE_RUN</i> for <i>regular_run</i> and <i>POST_RUN</i> for <i>regular_run_post_run</i>.
      There is also the second argument <i>$2</i>, which includes a definition of <i>regular_run_statfile</i>.
      <br>
      <br>
      This is how the regular_run for a modem currently works:
      <ul>
        <li>If <i>regular_run</i> is defined, it's executed with arguments <i>PRE_RUN</i> and <i>regular_run_statfile</i>.
            A modem is closed while the script is running.
            <i>regular_run_statfile</i> is available from the previous run.
        </li>
        <li><i>regular_run_statfile</i> is deleted.
        </li>
        <li>If <i>regular_run_cmdfile</i> is defined and the file exists, commands from this file are sent to the modem.
            If <i>regular_run_logfile</i> is defined, results are written to the file.
            If <i>regular_run_statfile</i> is defined, results are written to this file too.
            NOTE: <i>regular_run_cmdfile</i> is deleted after commands are handled.
            Use PRE_RUN phase or an external process to create this file.
        </li>
        <li>If <i>regular_run_cmd</i>, one or more, is defined, commands are sent to the modem.
            Results are logged and written to the statfile, if defined.
        </li>
        <li>If <i>regular_run_post_run</i> is defined, it's executed with arguments <i>POST_RUN</i> and <i>regular_run_statfile</i>.
        </li>
      </ul>

  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>29.03.2010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.7beta2</b>
</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>
      Smsd can connect directly to the network modem.
      This enhancement is provided by Hubert Gilch, SEP Logistik AG.
      </p><p>
      A <i>device</i> definition which starts with <b>@</b> character is handled as a socket.
      Format for the internet host is: <i>@&lt;host_or_ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</i>.
      Host definition can be name or IP address.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>socket_connection_retries = number</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>11</i>.</font><br>
      Defines how many times smsd will retry when a socket connection fails.
      When maximum number of retries is reached, modem process will call alarmhandler and stop.
      With value -1 smsd will retry forever.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>socket_connection_alarm_after = number</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>0</i>.</font><br>
      After defined number of retries, an alarmhandler is called.
      Smsd still continues trying, if <i>socket_connection_retries</i> value is bigger.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>report_device_details = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>no/yes</i>.</font><br>
      Defines if a details from device are printed to the log when modem process is starting.
      With beta versions of smsd this setting defaults to <i>yes</i>, otherwise it defaults to <i>no</i>.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>using_routed_status_report = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>no</i>.</font><br>
      Smsd can detect routed status reports, but usually it's not recommended to use them.
      Modems should store status reports as an ordinary messages, which can be read when smsd will need them.
      However, some modem cannot store status reports, and therefore routing is the only way to get them.
      With this setting smsd will change some severity and text of a logging.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>routed_status_report_cnma = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>yes</i>.</font><br>
      Defines if +CNMA acknowledgement is needed to send after routed status report was received.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>phonecalls_purge = yes/no/string</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>no</i>.</font><br>
      Usually missed calls are deleted from the device using AT+CPBW=index command.
      Some modems do not support this command, and have an alternative way to clear Missed Calls storage.
      With setting <i>yes</i>, this feature uses Siemens compatilbe way for purging: <i>AT^SPBD="MC"</i>.
      Another command can be defined as a string.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>voicecall_vts_quotation_marks = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>no</i>.</font><br>
      Defines if quotation marks are used when sending VTS command to the modem.
      NOTE: previously quotation marks were used, now this setting default to <i>no</i>.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>voicecall_cpas = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>no</i>.</font><br>
      Defines if AT+CPAS is used to detect when a call is answered.
      This is required if modem returns OK immediately after the call.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>needs_wakeup_at = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>no</i>.</font><br>
      After being idle, some modems do not answer to the first AT command.
      For example with BenQ M32, there can be OK answer, but in many times there is not.
      To avoid error messages, smsd first send AT and read the answer if it's available.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>keep_messages = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>no</i>.</font><br>
      Defines if messages are not deleted from the device.
      Unlike a global setting <i>keep_messages</i>, smsd continues running.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>New global setting: <i><b>umask = value</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>empty</i>.</font><br>
      Effective umask for smsd can be set in the configuration file.
      Value can be hexadecimal, decimal or octal format.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>New global setting: <i><b>log_unmodified = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>no</i>.</font><br>
      In some cases, when resolving troubles with a modem, it's useful to see what kind of line ends were received from the modem.
      With this setting spaces and line ends are not removed from the string which is logged.
      This setting overrides the setting <i>log_single_lines</i>.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>New global setting: <i><b>trim_text = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>yes</i>.</font><br>
      With this setting trailing whitespaces are removed from the outgoing message.
      Does not effect with messages written using Unicode or GSM alphabet.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      When a modem process is starting, it's checked if reading of messages is supported.
      This version will not do the check, if a device is not going to read incoming messages.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      When checking the PIN, some modems include quotation marks in the answer.
      Some modems may leave a space away after <i>+CPIN:</i>.
      Those kind of answers are now handled.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      When initializing a modem, and it does not respond, after 5 retries the port is closed and reopened.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      When handling the smsc setting from configuration file, extra + sign is removed from it.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      Message counter file (for example GSM1.counter) is always created, even when messages are not yet sent.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      Startup check will check that any modem does not use duplicate device name.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      Locked files in the spooler: as in the past, <i>*.LOCK</i> files are handled as locked files, and now
      <i>LOCKED*</i> files are handled as locked too.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      When using a communication mode, it's no longer necessary that the name of a modem is in the <i>devices</i> list.
      It's enough that a section for the modem exists.
      Note, that still no more than one smsd can run at the same time.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      When sending SMS and From field is not defined, content of a setting <i>number</i> is printed to the log:
      "Sending SMS from &lt;number&gt; to &lt;destination&gt;".
      If the setting <i>number</i> is not defined, log line is as before: "Sending SMS from &nbsp;to &lt;destination&gt;".
  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Bug fixes:
<ol start="24">
  <li><p>
      When a GMGL list was handled and sorted, older message was not read first.
      With this fix messages are sorted by the date and time when a message was sent.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      When reading messages from the modem, some modems return only LF characters, even when both CR and LF should be returned.
      Some modems may give the answer with double line-ending. Both cases are now handled.
  </p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b>01.02.2010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.7beta</b>
</p>

This is not the major version change, it's publishing is still delayed.
This version continues 3.1.x and contains some minor features which may be useful for some users.

<ol>
  <li><p>New global setting: <i><b>ignore_exec_output = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>no</i>.</font><br>
      Usually eventhandlers should not output anything.
      If there is some output, it usually means that some error has occurred.
      These errors are often problematic, because that output cannot be seen and error is therefore not notified.
      Smsd will print any output from the evenhandlers to the log file.
      This output can also be used for debugging purposes, but usually debugging should be done by running eventhandler manually.
      With a setting <i>ignore_exec_output = yes</i> this feature can be disabled.
  </p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>
<b>30.11.2009&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.6</b>
</p>

This version was released because of a critical bug in the handling of a concatenation storage.
Users of version 3.1.5 should upgrade to this version.
As a workaround, disable purging of a concatenation storage with a global setting in the smsd.conf: <i>ic_purge_hours = 0</i>.
If <i>ic_purge_minutes</i> was set, remove the setting or change it to 0.

<ol>
  <li><p>
      Outgoing message files with the same timestamp are selected by name.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      Carriage return characters are removed from the modem response when writing it to the log.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      Trouble logging is slightly enhanced: if something was printed to the log and trouble is over, "Everything is ok now" is printed to the trouble log.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      Regular_run_statfile is created using the same mask as the message files.
  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>

<p>
<b>01.06.2009&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.5</b>
</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>New global setting: <i><b>smart_logging = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>no</i>.</font><br>
      This feature is available when file based logging is used.
      If <i>loglevel</i> is less than 7 (for example "notice" is a good choise with smart_logging), 
      trouble log (with loglevel 7) about whole communication is written to different file if there has been any errors.
      <p>
      "Whole communication" means sending single SMS, receiving single SMS, and other things what smsd will do after idle time is spent.
      When communication starts, all possible log lines are collected to internal buffer and only <i>loglevel</i> lines are written to the <i>logfile</i>.
      If during communication there are any errors, all collected lines are printed to trouble log when communication reaches it's end.
      </p>
      <p>
      This feature was made because with loglevel 7 logfile grows very much and fast, and debug level is not usually needed when there was no any errors.
      In case of errors it's important to see whole communication, not just a single line which says that "something happened".

      New setting for a modem: <i><b>communication_delay = number</b></i><br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>0</i>.</font><br>
      Only some very problematic modems may need this setting.

  </p></li>
  <li><p>New global setting: <i><b>status_interval = number</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>1</i>.</font><br>
      If statistics function is enabled and <i>stats</i> directory is defined, smsd writes file named <b><i>status</i></b> into this directory.
      The file contains status of all modems in the first line using <i>Status:</i> header (this is similar than smsd -s outputs to console) and 
      explained status in the next lines using modem's name as a header.
      Smsd writes status file every <i>status_interval</i> seconds if a status has changed. Value 0 disables this feature.
      <p>
      For example, the output is like:
<pre>
Status:     09-05-27 20:46:17, irir------------
SONERA:     09-05-27 20:46:09, Idle,      123, 0, 321, ssi: -63 dBm, ber: &lt; 0.2 %
ELISA:      09-05-27 20:46:12, Receiving, 234, 0, 432, ssi: -73 dBm, ber: &lt; 0.2 %

</pre>
      </p><p>
      Timestamp value tells when status is created or modem initialization was last started.
      </p><p>
      Status can be: (s) Sending, (r) Receiving, (i) Idle, (b) Blocked, (t) Trouble, (-) Unknown.
      Trouble -status means that something abnormal has happened and if smart_logging is in use, trouble log will be written.
      </p><p>
      Counters are: sent, failed, received.
      Sent counter is the value from <i>stats/&lt;modemname&gt;.counter</i> file. Smsd does not clear this value.
      Failed and received counters are from original statistics data and they are cleared each time when stats are stored (<i>stats_interval</i>), or smsd is restarted.
      </p>

      <i><b>status_signal_quality = yes/no</b></i><br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>yes</i>.</font><br>

      <i><b>max_continuous_sending = number</b></i><br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>300 (5 min)</i>.</font><br>
      As usual, modem setting overrides global setting.
      This setting is in seconds and defines how long modem can send messages without doing anything else.
      After <i>max_continuous_sending</i> time is reached, received messages are checked and other tasks are run.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      Number of modems can be defined in the <b>src/Makefile</b>. Default value is 64.
      If you are running SMSTools3 in an embedded device, you can use <i>NUMBER_OF_MODEMS=1</i> to save memory.
      This setting also affects the number of provider queues.
      If you need more provider queues than you have modems, just increase the number of modems value.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      Modem setting <i>init2</i> can be used to monitor signal quality.
      When init2 contains AT+CSQ (uppercase), signal quality is explained in the log file using log level "notice".

      Now: "The modem did not answer (expected OK)." or "The modem answer was not OK: &lt;the answer what it was&gt;" depending on the answer.
      This change is because in some cases it's important to see if there was any answer or not.

      New section in configuration file: <b>[default]</b>.
      This section can be used to define default settings for all modems.
      If setup has large count of similar modems, almost all settings can be defined once in [default] section and only device depended
      settings like <i>device</i> are required to define in the modem sections.
      In the future versions this will replace all modem settings which are now defined in the global part of configuration.
      </p><p>
      As "default" is now reserved name, it cannot be used as a modem name.

      <font size="1">Default value: <i>yes</i>.</font><br>
      Before any command is sent to the modem, smsd checks if there is some unexpected input.

      If signal quality is asked from a modem (when initializing it or when running a regular_run),
      the result is explained in the log file.<br>
      For example:
<pre>
2009-03-17 12:40:05,5, GSM1: CMD: AT+CSQ: +CSQ: 20,0 OK

  <li><p>
      New setting for a modem: <i><b>detect_message_routing = yes/no</b></i><br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>yes</i>.</font><br>
      By default smsd tries to detect if a modem is in message routing mode.
      Before sending a command smsd listens if some data with routed message is available.
      Also, after a command is sent, smsd checks the answer.
      In both cases, if there is one or more routed message coming, a notification is written to the log and alarmhandler is called.
      Routed messages are saved and handled later when smsd can do it.
      <p>
      NOTE: This checking is done to avoid errors and loss of messages.
      Routing mode SHOULD NOT BE USED in normal operation.
      With routing mode it is NOT quaranteed that all messages are delivered.
      Some devices are in routing mode by default and this feature helps to detect it.
      Use <i>init = AT+CNMI=...</i> with suitable values to disable routing mode.
      Values depend on modem, see the manual of a modem for details.
      All received messages must be stored to the message store which is usually "SM" (SIM card memory).

  <li><p>New global setting: <i><b>shell = filename</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>/bin/sh</i>.</font><br>

      <p>
      During the startup check it is now verified that the shell is accessible and it works.
      Runtime errors are now logged with details.
      </p>
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      If running of eventhandler or regular_run fails, an administrative alert is sent (if <i>admin_to</i> is specified).
      Each process has it's own error status and while the error remains, no more messages are sent unless the problem is first solved.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>New global setting: <i><b>adminmessage_device = name</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: <i>first available device</i>.</font><br>
      This settings defines which modem is used to send administrative messages when mainspooler detects some trouble.

      New settings for a modem:<br>
      <i><b>adminmessage_limit = number</b></i><br>

      <i><b>adminmessage_count_clear = number</b></i><br>
      <font size="1">Default value: 0.</font><br>
      With these settings sending of administrative messsages can be limited.
      <i>adminmessage_limit</i>, defines a maximum number of messages to be sent.
      <i>adminmessage_count_clear</i> defines a period to automatically clear the message counter.
      This value is number of minutes.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
      Timeout for message sending is increased.
      If your modem still gets timeout, use a modem setting <i>read_timeout = 10</i> to increase value even more.

      USSD messages using regular run for a modem feature: You can use a <i>regular_run_cmd</i> = <b>AT+CUSD=1,"*100#",0;</b> to get saldo details of a prepaid SIM.
      When a command starts with AT+CUSD and the length is more than 9 characters, smsd will wait response which starts with <b>+CUSD:</b> instead of OK string.
      For example in Finland the response in the log file will be like (here split into three lines):
<pre>
2009-03-30 11:56:00,5, GSM1: CMD: AT+CUSD=1,"*100#",0;:

  <li><p>
      Sample script sendsms now checks if an user "smsd" is existing, and if it is, ownership of an outgoing file is given to the user "smsd".
      If you are using some else unpriviledged user to run smsd, change the script variable "smsd_user".

      If there are message parts older than defined with <i>ic_purge_hours</i> and/or <i>ic_purge_minutes</i> settings,
      message parts are deleted. If <i>ic_purge_read</i> is <i>yes</i>, message is stored to the incoming folder.
      In this case there will be only one part in the file and a header <i>Incomplete: yes</i> indicates that message is broken.

      These settings are used only with SIM600 (or compatible) modems (<i>check_memory_method</i> 5).
      If multipart message is received with one or more parts missing, incomplete message is removed from the message storage after time defined.
      Time is calculated from timestamp of first available part.
      Value 0 for both settings disables this feature.
      Setting <i>ms_purge_read</i> defines if parts are read before they are deleted.
      If <i>internal_combine</i> setting is used, parts are stored to the concatenation storage.
      If missing part(s) are later received, there will be similar timeout before parts are purged.
      After this the messsage is complete and is stored to the incoming folder.

      <i>put_command(modem, devices[device].name,devices[device].send_delay, tmp, answer, sizeof(answer), 50, <b>"(\\+CMGL:.*OK)|(ERROR)"</b>);</i><br>
      Change the last argument to <b>"(OK)|(ERROR)"</b>.

  <li><p>
      Modem setting <i>send_delay = number</i> has slightly enhanced:<br>
      Value 0 now means that whole string is sent at once without any delays.
      This resolves slow communication with LAN based multiport servers, like Digi Portserver II.
      If, for some reason, "tcdrain" is still needed after sending, use value -1.

After 3.1beta was released at march 2007, lot of changes are tested and implemented to the "stable" version of smsd.
This new 3.1beta7 contains all changes and features included in the 3.0.10.
Because the feature list of beta's was quite long, it's shortened and this new list contains only the changes and additions
not included in the 3.0.10. Older beta versions are removed from the download area because there is no reason to use them.
</p>

<p>
Configuration file (smsd.conf):
<ol>
  <li><p>New global setting: <i><b>saved = directory</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: empty.</font><br>
      If defined, smsd will store concatenation storage's to this directory (otherwise incoming directory is used).
      At startup check existing concatenation storages are moved from incoming directory to saved directory.
      Zero sized files are ignored.
      If both directories has a storage file with data, fatal error is produced and the smsd does not start.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New global setting: <i><b>phonecalls = directory</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: empty.</font><br>

  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>phonecalls = yes/no</b></i>.<br>
      <font size="1">Default value: no.</font><br>
      Report phonecalls. Currently only missed calls are reported.<br>
      When a phonecall entry is read from the phone, eventhandler is executed with argument $1 = CALL.
      This event can be used to make some actions after an unanswered phonecall is received.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New global setting: <i><b>language_file = filename</b></i>.<br>

  <li><p>Primary_memory and Secondary_memory settings can now have multiple parameters defined, like SM,SM,SM.
      Double-quotation marks are not necessary to use in the string.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>All yes/no values are checked, also the "no" value should be typed correctly.
      Previously all incorrect values were interpreted as "no".
      This might have an effect if you have errors in the current setup.
      Possible errors are reported at startup and the smsd does not start spooling.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Device names are checked. Only alphanumeric characters, underline, minus-sign and dot are allowed.

  <li><p>Binary message can be automatically splitted to the concatenated messages.
      With Autosplit value of 0 message is not sent if it does not fit in the single message.
      All other Autosplit values cause concatenated UDH part to be inserted to the message parts.
      If a message starts with UDH data (which is the default for binary messages), concatenation header
      is inserted to the existing user data header. If there is no UDH by the user, a new header is
      created.

  <li><p>Voicecall can now have <i><b>TIME: number</b></i> defined, where number is number of seconds to keep modem calling.
      After a time has reached, hang up is done.
      If a call is answered before a time is reached, normal sound playing is done.
      NOTE that this time counting starts after a command is given to the modem and there will be
      some delay before receiving device starts ringing.

  <li><p>Execution order of eventhandler has changed: eventhandler is executed after a file is moved to it's

  </p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE</b> for users running smsd with very heavy load:
<ul>Current version of smsd moves files between spooler directories using the original file name.
    If outgoing files are created using a fixed filename (which is not recommended) and lot of 
    files using the same name are created within a short period, it's possible that previous file
    and it's .LOCK file are still existing in the spooler directory. In this case a new file cannot 
    be moved to the spool. Previously the smsd stopped with a fatal error in this case. Now an 
    alarmhandler is called and after it has returned a file moving is retried. If a file still
    cannot be moved, the smsd will stop with a fatal error.<br>
    <br>
    The alarmhandler can be used to help with a file moving conflict. The script can wait until
    a spooler can be used, or it can wait some fixed time like 5 seconds. It can also produce some
    notices to the administration, if necessary.<br>
    <br>
    In some cases this kind of conflict is a result of a previously happened error in the system
    which creates outgoing files to send. In this case it's better to let smsd stop, instead of
    sending couple of thousand messages to somewhere...<br>
    <br>
    In the conflict case the alarmhandler will get following arguments (as an example):
    <ul>
      <li>$1=ALARM
      </li>
      <li>$2=2007-07-06
      </li>
      <li>$3=12:00:00
      </li>
      <li>$4=2
      </li>
      <li>$5=smsd
      </li>
      <li>$6=Conflict with .LOCK file in the spooler: /var/spool/sms/outgoing/test_file /var/spool/sms/checked
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
General:
<ol>
  <li><p>All incoming PDU's are checked comprehensively.
      If there is some illegal values in the content or illegal characters in the string or some characters are missing,
      a problem is reported and handling of a broken PDU is aborted.
      However, all possible junk cannot be detected because the PDU does not have any checksums.
    <ul>
      <li>In case of errors a new header <i><b>Error: explanation</b></i> is printed to the message file.
          With existense of this header it's easy to detect that there is no usual message content in the file.
          Text part will tell more details of errors found.
      </li>
      <li>In the successfully processed message file there can be one or more <i>Warning: explanation</i> headers
          telling that some minor issues has detected, but the message is still processed.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p></li>

  <li><p>If an incoming PDU does not match to the <i>mode</i> setting defined in the smsd.conf file,
      alternative mode is tried before error is reported and handling is aborted.
      This means that the mode setting is now automatic for PDU's of incoming messages.
      Note that the outgoing side works like before and you have to use correct mode -setting in the configuration file.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Number of devices is increased to 64.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>While reading a PDU from file, a first line starting with PDU: and space is taken if any exists.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>There is a simple script <i>smstest.php</i> included in the scripts directory.
      This script can be used to create sms files using a web browser.
      The script demonstrates a character set conversion made with PHP and can be used for testing purposes.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Installation / uninstallation: path of executables can now be defined in the Makefile.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Startup check: permission check for executable scripts is changed.
      Previously this check required mode 750 for scripts.
      Now owner and group settings are examined and permission is checked like a shell does.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) is asked once from the modem when it's first time initialized.
      If a device supports this query, information is printed to each incoming message file as a new header:
      <i><b>IMSI: 123456789</b></i>.
      <br>
      This header is also inserted to sent and failed files.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Running as an unpriviledged user: if <i>user</i> is set but <i>group</i> is unset, that user's normal groups (e.g. from
      /etc/groups) are used.
      This means you can allow other users on the system access to write messages to the outgoing spool without giving them
      direct access to the serial port.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>When finding files from the spooler directories, the oldest file is selected.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>If a file in the spool directory cannot be handled because of file mode or ownership, 
      error message is printed to the log and alarm handler is called.
      As soon as the problem is fixed, a file is processed normally.
      If a file is deleted (outside of smsd), the smsd forgets past problems with it and in the future a file 
      with the same name is processed as usual.
  </p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Outgoing message file:
<ol start="12">
  <li><p>New header: <i><b>Replace: code</b></i>. Code can be a number from 1 to 7.
      If a receiving device and SIM supports "Replace Short Message Type n" -feature, a previously
      received message with the same code is replaced with a new message. Only the messages sent from
      the same originating address can be replaced. If there is nothing to replace, a message is stored
      in the normal way.<br>
      Note that the smsd does not use this value while sending concatenated (multipart) message.
      This is because some phones do not understand concatenated message as a single message and
      therefore a previously received part might become overwritten if a replace code is used.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>SMSC setting is allowed only if there is a smsc set in the config file.
  </p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Incoming message file:
<ol start="14">
  <li><p>New header: <i><b>From_TOA: string</b></i>.
      Includes a Type Of Address definition with short explanation,
      like: "From_TOA: 91 international, ISDN/telephone".
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New header: <i><b>Report: yes/no</b></i>.
      Tells if a status report is going to be returned to the SME.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New header: <i><b>Replace: number</b></i>.
      This header is included if a message has a Replace Short Message Type 1..7 (number) defined.
  </p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Configuration file (smsd.conf):
<ol start="17">
  <li><p>Setting: <i>pdu_from_file = filename / dirname/</i> is slightly enhanced.
      The original setting style will work when it points to the file which is read and then deleted.
      If this setting ends with a slash and a directory with that name exists,
      file(s) are read from this directory (and deleted after processing).
      All files found from the given directory are processed one by one, expect hidden files (name begins with a dot).
      When this setting points to the directory, no dot's are allowed in any position of a path.
      Be very careful with this setting while it will delete the content of a whole directory.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting: <i><b>log_charconv = yes/no</b></i>.
      Default is <i>no</i>.
      With this setting a details of character set conversions (outgoing UTF-8 to ISO conversion and incoming GSM/ISO to 
      UTF-8 conversion) is printed to the log.
      If smsd is compiled using DEBUGMSG definition, details are also printed to the console.
      Logging feature can be useful if you have some troubles with characters and like to know what exactly happens inside the smsd.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>modem_disabled = yes/no</b></i>.
      Default is <i>no</i>.
      This is for testing purposes. Whole messaging system including eventhandlers etc. can be tested without any working
      modem existing. Sending of messages is simulated in the similar way than with <i>sending_disabled</i> setting.
      Incoming messages are taken only from the file, if <i>pdu_from_file</i> is defined.
      No any communication is made between smsd and modem, but a device setting should still exist because smsd wants to
      open and close a device.
      If in you testing environment you do not have a priviledges to the usual modem device,
      like /dev/ttyS0, you can use a definition like <i>device = /tmp/modemfile</i>.
      If this file exists and is writable for the process owner, it's enough for smsd.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Startup check will now report if there is a queue defined but no provider numbers for it.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New global setting: <i><b>store_sent_pdu = value</b></i>.
      Default is <i>1</i>.
      Possible values are: 0 = no PDU's are stored, 1 = failed (to send) PDU's are stored, 
      2 = failed PDU's and PDU's of binary/Unicode messages are stored, 3 = all PDU's are stored.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Validity period setting now accepts keywords typed mixed/upcase.
      Keyword can now be given without any numbers, like <i>month</i> means the same than <i>1 month</i>.
      This same applies to the outgoing message files.
      When the smsd is started, a validity period setting is reported to the log if the setting used is less than maximum.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Each provider can now have up to 64 numbers defined.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Queue, provider and device/queues settings are checked.
      If there is too much definitions, an error message is displayed and the daemon does not start.
  </p></li>

  <li><p><i>stats_interval</i> defaults to 3600 (1 hour).
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting: <i><b>blockafter = number</b></i>. Defines number of errors which will cause modem to be blocked. Default value is 3.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>outgoing = yes/no</b></i>.
      Default is <i>yes</i>.
      If set to <i>no</i>,  a modem does not handle any outgoing message(s).
  </p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Bug fixes:
<ol start="28">
  <li><p>The smsd accepted definition of providers only if it was written as [provider] in the configuration file.
      Now singular/plural does not matter anymore, you can use [provider] or [providers].
      This same applies to the queues: both definitions [queue] and [queues] are accepted.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>When alphanumeric senders had length more than 9 characters, garbage was appended to the sender's name.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Setting of validity period did not accept clean numeric value, like 204 (for 12 weeks).
      An error message was produced and a default value (maximum possible time) was used.
      Validity setting also calculated some values incorrectly, like "3 months" produced a maximum time (63 weeks).
  </p></li>

  <li><p>SMSC setting in the message file did not work. However, usually this setting should not be used.

<b>20.06.2007&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.0.9beta</b>
</p>

<p>
Outgoing message file:
<ol>
  <li><p>When sending ISO coded message, all characters which cannot be transferred using the GSM character set
      are replaced with their alternatives. For example  becomes E,  becomes o and so on.
      In the previous versions of smsd there was a replacement made only for few characters.
  </p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Configuration file (smsd.conf):
<ol start="2">
  <li><p>New setting: <i><b>outgoing_utf8 = yes/no</b></i>.
      Default is <i>yes</i>.
      With this setting automatic UTF-8 to ISO conversion of outgoing files can be switched off, if necessary.
  </p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Bug fixes:
<ol start="3">
  <li><p>Internal decoding of Unicode message was not done if a message contained only single part
      and no user data header including concatenation information. (Some devices include contatenation
      header even if there is only one part).

<p>
<b>03.06.2007&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.0.8</b>
</p>

<p>
General:
<ol>
  <li><p>Some modem(s), probably because of the firmware bug, gives an "OK" answer while trying to read
      a message from the empty memory space. This causes an additional five seconds delay to the process,
      because an "ERROR" answer is expected. New version of smsd accepts both messages without any
      additional delay.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>While a PIN code status is asked from the modem, some modems do not include "OK" result code in the response.
      This has caused an additional delay with those modems. Handling of response is changed to avoid delays.
      Also some informative message logging is added to the modem initialization.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>If a modem does not accept the PIN code, the modem process will terminate immediately.
      Previously it tried to use the same incorrect PIN again and again, 
      and this caused SIM card to be locked and the PUK code was then required.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>When a message is sent successfully, possible previous errors with a modem are forgotten.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Logging of character set conversation problems is changed from LOG_INFO to LOG_NOTICE.
      Log lines have now name of a modem.
  </p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Configuration file (smsd.conf):
<ol start="6">
  <li><p>New setting: <i><b>incoming_utf8 = yes/no</b></i>.
      Incoming message files with ISO or GSM alphabet can be saved using UTF-8 character set.
      Default is <i>no</i>.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>If a modem needs some idle time after a PIN is entered, new setting <i><b>pinsleeptime</b></i> can be used to produce that.  
      This value is seconds.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New setting for a modem: <i><b>pre_init = yes/no</b></i>.
      This settting defaults to "yes" and causes "echo off" and "CMEE=1" commands to be sent to the modem

  <li><p>Termination handling is changed. Previously the main process sent SIGTERM to the whole process group.
      With sh shell it was possible that incorrect processes were killed because they were running in the same process group.
      Also processes started from the eventhandler received SIGTERM and eventhandler was terminated before the job was completelly done.
      New version of smsd sends SIGTERM to the modem processes only. This allows smooth shutdown to the eventhandlers.
      If there is some eventhandlers running while the smsd gets a termination signal, an information is written to the logfile
      and main process will wait until all modem processes are terminated.

<h4>The major change is done to daemonizing:</h4>
When smsd is started to background (which is default), it forks itself before running processes are created.
This solves some issues when the smsd is started from the sh shell.
</p>
<p>
It is no more necessary to use the & sign at the end of a starting command line.
</p>
<p>
There is a command line switch <b>-t</b> available to force smsd to run in terminal (foreground).
If logging or debugging messages are printed to the terminal, smsd runs in foreground by default.
There is also TERMINAL keyword available in the Makefile to force smsd to run in foreground.
</p>
<p>
The start-stop script <b>sms3</b> is updated.
The smsd now removes possible <i>infofile</i> and <i>*.LOCK</i> files at startup,
it is no more necessary to take care of them in the script.<br>
New script can be used with most operating systems. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
General:
<ol>
  <li><p>The smstools uses ISO character set in message files.
      If a locale is set to UTF-8, smsd does not handle outgoing message files correctly.
      There is sample scripts <b>checkhandler-utf-8</b> and <b>eventhandler-utf-8</b> in the scripts directory
      to demonstrate how character set conversation can be made using checkhandler and eventhandler.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>While smsd reads the configuration, all string length's are checked to prevent possible buffer overflows.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>More checks are done at startup. Fatal errors while reading the config are written to the log and 
      starting the daemon is prevented. Executable permissions of eventhandler(s) are checked.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Lockfile is detected by finding ".LOCK" from the end of filename instead of the whole string.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>A logfile setting can be made using the command line argument <i>-l</i> (ell).
      This overrides the config file setting.

</ol>
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE for Windows users:</b> If you are running smsd as a Windows service, you need to update settings of cygrunsrv.

Outgoing message file:
<ol start="8">
  <li><p>Priority can be set to high. This also works while the Provider Queue is used.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Message validity time can be selected for the message.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>It's possible to make a voice call with DTMF tones.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Binary messages can be presented as a Hex in the message file. There is a Wap Push demo using this feature.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>After a message is sent, <b>Message_id</b> is stored to the file if a status report was requested.

<p>
General:
<ol start="13">
  <li><p>A new sms3 script is available (in the scripts directory) as an alternative for the original sms script.
      This new script handles some special issues, including a smoother shutdown, multiple instance prevention and force-stop ability.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>If a modem reading reaches timeout, it will be reported to the log file.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>If for some reason the file moving fails, destination lock is removed.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>While creating a log file, file access permissions are limited to 640 (-rw-r-----).
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Provider definition can now have 's' for short numbers. For example: "FINLAND = 358, s".
      If this is not defined to any provider, outgoing message file must have a provider queue setting while sending to short number.</b>
  </p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Bug fixes:
<ol start="18">
  <li><p>In the outgoing message file the "UDH: yes/no" setting did not work correctly.
      However using this setting is not necessary because this value defaults to true when it's needed.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Short number preceeding with 's' caused number become empty and sending failed.
  </p></li>
</ol>
